```{r echo = FALSE}

library(plotly)
```

This is a site for my friends and I to decide where to go when we want a night out on the town! It has been proven that when options are maximized, fun is maximized (Disclaimer: false statement). You can observe this in the following plot:

```{r echo = FALSE}
fun_data <- data.frame(fun_level = c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16), options = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4))

fun_plot <- ggplot(fun_data, aes(x = options, y = fun_level)) +
  geom_line(color = "#20B2AA") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Fun Level vs. Options",
    x = "Options",
    y = "Fun Level"
  )

ggplotly(fun_plot)

```
